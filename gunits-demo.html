			This is not another grid system.

		<div class="grid-unit mod-good">
			This is a different way of designing responsive web sites. 
		</div>
		<div class="grid-unit">
			It avoids the chaos of fluid or liquid design, and instead gives control back to the designer.
		</div>
		<div class="grid-unit">
			Resize this page. Notice how everything on this page scales, as if it were a graphic.
		</div>
		<div class="grid-unit">
			Text wraps in a fairly predictable manner. (Save for some subpixel rendering.)
		</div>
		<div class="grid-unit mod-good">
			There are no gaps or "squishy" containers.
		</div>
		<div class="grid-unit">
			When the text gets too large or too small, the layout shifts to more or less columns like you would expect.
		</div>
		<div class="grid-unit">
			But, the grid squares and text size stay in proportion.
		</div>
		<div class="grid-unit mod-good">
			How does it work?
		</div>
		<div class="grid-unit">
			At its core, we set the document font size in vw units, and manipulate it at certain breakpoints.
		</div>
		<div class="grid-unit">
			We use rems to size everything else. And I mean everything.
		</div>
		<div class="grid-unit mod-good">
			Your patterns will scale consistently, and your layouts neatly add up to 100%.
		</div>
		<div class="grid-unit mod-danger">
			But I don't recommend you try it from scratch before looking at my code.
		</div>
		<div class="grid-unit">
			It turns out that the breakpoints are pretty tricky.
		</div>
		<div class="grid-unit">
			So I created "Gunits", a LESS package that makes it easier to manage.
		</div>
		<div class="grid-unit">
			The @gu variable represents one grid unit.
			At any breakpoint.
		</div>
		<div class="grid-unit">
			(You don't have to be designing in a grid. @gu is just a rem value.)
		</div>
		<div class="grid-unit">
			So, 2 * @gu is two grid units, @gu / 2 is half a grid unit.
		</div>
		<div class="grid-unit mod-good">
			The result? This responsive grid is about 10 lines of CSS and contains no media queries.
		</div>
		<div class="grid-unit">
			One bonus, is that you can opt out at any time.
		</div>
		<div class="grid-unit">
			Simply stop using rems or @gu and you're back to good old liquid design.
		</div>
